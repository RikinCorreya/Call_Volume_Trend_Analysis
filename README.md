# Call_Volume_Trend_Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing Customer Experience (CX) data from an inbound calling team. There is a 23-day dataset that includes details like agent names, queue times, call times, durations, and call statuses (e.g., abandoned, answered, or transferred).
•In the given project we have to calculate the average call duration and total number of call per hour
•We had to propose a manpower plan required during each time bucket and reduce the abandon rate to 10%
